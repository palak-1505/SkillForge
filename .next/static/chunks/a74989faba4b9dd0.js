Start applying early."},{year:"Third Year",question:"Which programming language/technology should I master?",answer:"Depends on your interest: Python for AI/ML, JavaScript/TypeScript for Web Dev, C++/Java for system-level or competitive programming."},{year:"Third Year",question:"Should I focus on DSA or practical projects?",answer:"Balance both. DSA is key for interviews; projects demonstrate practical skills and initiative."},{year:"Third Year",question:"Is research important or should I just focus on industry skills?",answer:"Research is optional unless you plan for higher studies or AI roles. Industry skills are more important for software development jobs."},{year:"Third Year",question:"How do I prepare my GitHub and resume professionally?",answer:"Upload clean, well-documented projects on GitHub. Resume should highlight skills, projects, internships, and achievements concisely."},{year:"Third Year",question:"Should I start learning advanced topics like ML, Blockchain, Cloud?",answer:"Yes, if interested. Start with small projects or courses to get hands-on experience; don’t overwhelm yourself."},{year:"Third Year",question:"How to improve my CP rating quickly?",answer:"Solve problems consistently, participate in contests, analyze editorials, and learn from mistakes."},{year:"Third Year",question:"How to balance CP practice with projects and DSA?",answer:"Set dedicated time blocks: 1–2 hours of CP, DSA for interviews, projects for portfolio. Consistency beats cramming."},{year:"Third Year",question:"Should I focus on CP if I want a job in AI/ML?",answer:"CP improves problem-solving skills but for AI/ML also focus on Python, NumPy, Pandas, ML algorithms, and projects."},{year:"Third Year",question:"Which platforms are best for CP?",answer:"Codeforces, AtCoder, CodeChef, LeetCode, HackerRank, and TopCoder."},{year:"Fourth Year",question:"How to prepare for placements efficiently?",answer:"Focus on DSA, system design, and mock interviews. Revise past projects and practice behavioral questions."},{year:"Fourth Year",question:"Should I go for higher studies (MTech/MS) or job?",answer:"Depends on your long-term goal. Job if you want industry experience, MS/MTech if you want research or specialized roles."},{year:"Fourth Year",question:"How to choose between core CS roles, Web/AI/ML, or product-based roles?",answer:"Align choice with your interest, skills, and career goals. Try internships to understand the work before final decisions."},{year:"Fourth Year",question:"What are the important interview skills to focus on?",answer:"DSA, system design, problem-solving, coding efficiency, and behavioral skills."},{year:"Fourth Year",question:"How to do a final year project that is impressive but feasible?",answer:"Pick a topic you’re passionate about, use existing libraries/tools, keep scope realistic, and document everything properly."},{year:"General",question:"C++ vs Python vs Java for DSA & interviews — which to choose?",answer:"C++ for performance & competitive programming, Python for AI/ML, Java for readability & large-scale projects. Choose based on interest & job role."},{year:"General",question:"Web Development vs AI/ML vs App Development — which is best for career?",answer:"All are good. Web/App for product roles, AI/ML for analytics/intelligence, pick based on your interest & strength in math/logic."},{year:"General",question:"Do I need to be an expert in all CS subjects or focus on specialization?",answer:"Focus on fundamentals, DSA, and your chosen specialization. Depth is better than shallow knowledge everywhere."},{year:"General",question:"How to balance coding practice, projects, and learning new tech?",answer:"Time-block your week: daily coding, weekly projects, and monthly new tech exploration. Consistency is key."},{year:"General",question:"Should I focus on competitive programming or real-world projects?",answer:"Both matter. CP strengthens problem-solving; projects show practical skills.
